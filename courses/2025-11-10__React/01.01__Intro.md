These are my personal notes on **Chapter 1: Intro & Setup** from the Ultimate React Course by Jonas Schmedtmann. This chapter covers the initial orientation for the course, what React is and why it's important for building scalable web applications, and the recommended setup steps for following along.

Key tasks include downloading **starter code and final projects** from the official GitHub repository, installing **Node.js**, setting up **VS Code**, initializing a React project using *Create React App* or *Vite*, and reviewing the structure of course materials.

Core concepts introduced:
- The purpose and benefits of **React**
- How React compares to vanilla JavaScript
- Project folder setup and coding along
- Importance of hands-on coding vs passive watching
- Advice for pacing and progressing in the course

Real-world applications highlighted include building **dynamic websites**, **SaaS dashboards**, and **mobile-ready UIs** using React and industry tools such as **Redux**, **Tailwind**, and **React Query**[web:17][web:16].

<!-- Lesson Notes -->

***

### ▶️ L1: Course Overview & Projects


- The course follows a project-based approach, focusing on what React is and why it is the industry standard for building scalable UIs[web:17].
- Four major sections start from fundamentals (components, JSX, props, state, forms), progress to intermediate topics (data fetching, hooks), cover advanced concepts (performance, Redux, routing), and finish with building two professional-grade real apps.


### ▶️ L2: Download Starter Files

- All code for course projects: [https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/react-course](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/react-course)[web:16].
- Download starter code as ZIP, or clone with Git. Use final code for troubleshooting.


### ▶️ L3: Environment Setup (Node, VS Code)

- Required: Install latest Node.js and npm ([https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)), VS Code ([https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com)).
- Recommend installing VS Code extensions for JavaScript, React, Prettier, Git integration.


### ▶️ L4: Create React App / Vite

- Course starts with *Create React App* but also discusses *Vite* as a fast alternative for setting up React projects.


### ▶️ L5: Folder Structure & Coding Along

- Follow the video and code along—active coding is required to actually learn React skills.
- Each project or section folder mirrors the organization of concepts covered in the course.


### ▶️ L6: Best Practices & Pacing

- Take the course at your own pace—rewatch sections as needed.
- Focus on incremental learning, hands-on practice, and applying course concepts to personal or professional projects.
