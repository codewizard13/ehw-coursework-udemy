These are my personal notes on **Chapter 2: Modern React Fundamentals** from Jonas Schmedtmann’s Ultimate React Course. This chapter covers the foundational features of React 18 and explains why React’s component-based architecture is essential for building maintainable user interfaces.

Key concepts introduced include:
- Understanding **JSX** as an extension of JavaScript that resembles HTML but with full power of JavaScript.
- Defining and using **React components** (functional components).
- The importance of **props** for passing data and configuring components.
- Basic **state management** using the `useState` hook.
- Introduction to **event handling** and how React optimizes updates with **the virtual DOM**.
- Core React principles like declarative UI and one-way data flow.

This chapter lays the groundwork for creating interactive React applications and practicing key patterns that will be expanded in later lessons. Real-world applications emphasized include developing responsive web apps and complex UI components with reusable and composable code.

<!-- Lesson Notes -->

***

### ▶️ L1: JSX Syntax

- JSX allows writing HTML-like markup within JavaScript, which React then transforms to `React.createElement` calls.
- It supports dynamic expressions inside braces `{}` and conditional rendering.
- Helps declarative UI construction making code more readable and maintainable.


### ▶️ L2: Creating Functional Components

- Functional components are JavaScript functions returning JSX.
- They represent reusable UI building blocks.
- Naming convention uses PascalCase, e.g., `<MyComponent />`.


### ▶️ L3: Props Basics

- Props are inputs passed from parent to child components.
- They are read-only inside the child and allow customization of components.
- Example: `<Button text="Click me" />` passes a `text` prop.


### ▶️ L4: Managing State with useState

- `useState` hook adds local state to functional components.
- Returns a state variable and a setter function.
- Triggers re-render on state change, enabling dynamic UI updates.


### ▶️ L5: Event Handling

- React uses camelCase event handlers, e.g., `onClick`.
- Functions passed to events receive the event object.
- Synthetic events normalize browser behavior for consistent interaction.


### ▶️ L6: Virtual DOM Overview

- React keeps a virtual representation of the UI in memory.
- Efficiently calculates minimal DOM updates on state/prop changes.
- Improves performance and user experience in complex applications.
