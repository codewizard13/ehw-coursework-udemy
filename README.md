## ORGANIZATION 📂

This repository organizes all Udemy coursework notes and projects in a consistent, scalable folder structure designed for clarity and easy navigation.

- **Top-Level Structure:**  
  The root contains foundational folders such as `_css`, `_pix` (for images), `ehw-notes` (shared note resources), along with the course notes organized under the `courses/` subfolder.

- **Courses Folder:**  
  Each Udemy course gets its own dedicated subfolder within `courses/`.  
  The naming convention for these folders is:

  ```
  [YYYY-MM-DD]__[tag-description]
  ```

  - The **date portion** (`YYYY-MM-DD`) is the date on which you started taking notes for that particular course. This serves as a unique time-based identifier, helping to track when study began.  
  - The **tag-description** is a brief, underscore-separated phrase of 1 to 3 words representing the course subject or key focus area (e.g., `React`, `Python_Basics`, `Data_Science`).

- **Example:**  
  - A React course started on November 10, 2025, would be in folder:  
    `2025-11-10__React`  
  - A Python fundamentals course started on October 5, 2025, might be:  
    `2025-10-05__Python_Basics`

- **Course Folder Contents:**  
  Each course folder contains:  
  - An `index.md` file with metadata, course overview, and important details to differentiate courses started on the same day or with similar tags.  
  - Chapter notes files named by chapter number and title, e.g., `01__Intro-Setup.md`, `02__Modern-React-Fundamentals.md`, allowing sequential navigation through the course content.

- **Why this Structure?**  
  This scheme provides:  
  - Easy chronological tracking of study activities across multiple courses.  
  - Unique identifiability, preventing collisions if multiple courses on similar topics are started on the same day.  
  - Clear separation and encapsulation of each course's materials for modular review and maintenance.  
  - Harmonized folder and file naming conventions that aid automated tooling, indexing, and consistent referencing.

By adhering to this organized layout, the repository remains maintainable and scalable as new Udemy courses are undertaken and documented.
